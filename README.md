# Introduction
BrightNight is a custom weather system to allow for a brighter night \
For this plugin to work TimeOfDay is needed to tell the plugin when morning or night is \
ConsoleFilter is recomended to filter out commands that are generated by the plugin that you do not want to show up on your server console


## Configuration
#### playSoundAtSunset

Play a desired sound at sunset

#### sound

Location of the sound file you want to play \
The sound file needs to be from the game bundles \
check out this [Rust Assets Locations & Strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkole4/Rust-Assets-Locations-Strings/main/stringpool.txt) to find the location of the sound file you want to use

#### freezeMoon

Freeze moon at the top of the sky

#### syncInterval

```bash
The settings and options can be configured in the BrightNight file under the config directory. 
The use of a JSON editor or validation site such as jsonlint.com is recommended to avoid formatting issues and syntax errors.
```

```json
{
  "freezeMoon": false,
  "playSoundAtSunset": false,
  "sound": "assets/bundled/prefabs/fx/player/howl.prefab",
  "syncInterval": 5.0
